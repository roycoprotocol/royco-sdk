  description: `Goldilocks&#x27; yield splitting vaults enable users to trade the future earnings of yield bearing positions. Users can deposit assets into a yield splitting vault, and the vault will automatically use the assets to create yield bearing positions on supported platforms. Their Boyco markets will yield-split half of deposited assets, and LP the remainder against the OT (Ownership Token).

Deposit uniBTC on Ethereum Mainnet and bridge the asset to Berachain. On Berachain, mint uniBTC-OT and uniBTC-YT with a portion of the uniBTC via Goldilocks, then pair the minted uniBTC-OT and remaining uniBTC to provide liquidity in the uniBTC&lt;&gt;uniBTC-OT Kodiak Island, an automated liquidity management vault that tokenizes a &quot;concentrated&quot; range Uniswap V3 style liquidity position.`,
